    <h1>Bertie Bear Learns to play</h1>

    <p>
        Sitting over a cup of juice and a Jammy Dodger, Frank chats sociably with the bear friends who have come over to
        play for an hour. Bertie is still very unsure about having friends ( he tends to ignore people when they come
        over
        or gets over excited and frightens them away ) so we are playing for an hour at a time so as not to descend into
        stressful meltdown phase. Frank , on the other hand, is not overly impressed as it is ” nowhere near enough time
        to
        play a good game of pirates” but he is willing to go along with it for a while as even he becomes stressed out
        when
        Bertie displays signs of being overwhelmed!
    </p>

    <p>
        “So, we will get the Lego out and build a castle first” instructs Frank ” Bertie, you can find all the red
        bricks, Theo “, ( teddy friend from across the road, very cute and easy to get along with) ” you can look out
        the windows and doors for us and Betty “( a pretty girl teddy from Build a Bear with a purple bow and a REAL
        heart, something which has not gone unnoticed with Frank!) ” you can get all the trees and green bits to go
        around the castle”
    </p>

    <p>
        Frank looks around the table with an air of teddy bear authority ” We don’t have long so we’d better get a move
        on folks…. anyone not want their Jammy Dodger? ” This last request is aimed at Bertie who is still struggling to
        wean himself off the familiar Party Ring biscuits he so loved in foster bear. We are trying to introduce a wider
        variety of food into his diet but his need for control and security is hampering this somewhat. Frank, on the
        other hand, is making the most of this need to stick with the familiar and is happily hoovering up any bits that
        Bertie rejects. ( “you always told me we shouldn’t waste good food)” he splutters when I challenge him on his
        hoovering habits.( “I am doing us all a favour!”)
    </p>

    <p>
        The bear friends start to build the castle. Frank gently directs the others as the castle starts to take shape.
        All is well….for five minutes. I take the chance to go and sort the dishwasher out.
    </p>

    <p>
        ” Mummy!” yells Frank ” Bertie is pinching ALL the pieces! ” I ignore the cries at first. They need to sort out
        their teddy battles themselves….” Mummy! Mummy!”

        I go in and find Bertie and Frank in a battle over a piece of Lego, ” Give it back! ” shouts Bertie, pulling
        with all his might on the piece of yellow Lego that Frank had clutched between his paws. ” No, it’s mine! I am
        collecting the long pieces, you are getting the red ones”
    </p>

    <p>
        “NO! NO!NO! ” screams Bertie and runs into another room, taking the Lego with him. Betty and Theo stand and
        stare ” It’s only a bit of Lego ” says Theo sadly, and Betty starts to cry. The noise Bertie has made has upset
        her. I go and talk to Bertie and manage to persuade him to come back and play . We have to adjust the
        arrangements which Frank is not happy about. Bertie gets to make his own castle but stays in the room with
        everyone else. Peace descends….for three minutes…
    </p>

    <p>
        ” Mummy! Mummy! Bertie is hitting Betty and she is crying! ” Betty is wailing, pointing at Bertie and sobbing ”
        He, he , he …pushed me ” Bertie is screaming again. He is getting very angry. Frank is desperately trying to
        calm him down ” Bertie, stop it. You don’t behave like this when we have chaps over otherwise they won’t come
        again. Tell him Mum! ” Frank is panic stricken that Theo and Betty won’t come again. He loves to play and
        doesn’t understand that Bertie is just learning how to be around other teddies . Bertie didn’t go to pre school
        and didn’t mix with other bears until he moved to foster bear. He doesn’t understand that you have to take turns
        and let other bears have a go. Frank is becoming distraught. ” But Mummy, I told you, put Bertie on his own to
        play, then we will be ok , he’s just ruining it all, it’s not fair” and he bursts into exasperated sobs and
        throws himself on the floor. Oh dear… bear mayhem.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bertie is screaming, Betty is crying quietly and politely, Frank is howling and Theo, well , Theo bless him, is
        getting on with building the castle and ignoring the teddy bear meltdown that has broken out around him. I take
        Bertie off for cuddles and reassurance and a yellow Party Ring and the situation calms down. Sadly, by the time
        this happens, there is only ten minutes of play time left…
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the hazards of adopting a bear cub who has not been to pre school or who has not really mixed with other
        bears is that they really struggle to interact with others. Bertie really does not know how to do it. It’s a bit
        like learning to ride a teddy bear bike, It needs practice and time ( and BIG stabilisers!) Sometimes, though,
        along the way, that means that some teddy friendships suffer ( and big brother relationships!) Not everybody
        understands how difficult it is for Bertie to make friends. This is not solved easily and will take a lot of
        time and teddy bear patience.
    </p>

    <p>
        I often have to remind Frank that he struggled like this once and he is usually willing to accept that ( on
        condition that I say he progressed much quicker than Bertie is doing!)

        We never had Betty Bear over to play again There always seems to be a reason why she couldn’t come which was
        very sad as I think Frank as set his sights on her for a future wife! Frank tried his very best to persuade her
        that he could stick Bertie in a cupboard when she came round but the damage was done. Bertie was just too much
        of a challenge for her. ” Never mind,” Frank sighs ” there’s always Bubbles” ( a very soft, fluffy bear with a
        blue scarf with dots on who lives next door) ” we’ll ask her to play next week..”
