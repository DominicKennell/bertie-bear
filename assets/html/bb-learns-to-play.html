                    <p> Sitting over a cup of juice and a Jammy Dodger, Frank chats sociably with the bear friends who
                        have come over to play for an hour. Bertie is still very unsure about having friends ( he tends
                        to ignore people when they come over or gets over excited and frightens them away ) so we are
                        playing for an hour at a time so as not to descend into stressful meltdown phase. Frank , on the
                        other hand, is not overly impressed as it is ” nowhere near enough time to play a good game of
                        pirates” but he is willing to go along with it for a while as even he becomes stressed out when
                        Bertie displays signs of being overwhelmed </p>
