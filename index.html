                        <p>Sitting over a cup of juice and a Jammy Dodger, Frank chats sociably with the bear friends who
                            have come over to play for an hour. Bertie is still very unsure about having friends ( he tends
                            to ignore people when they come over or gets over excited and frightens them away ) so we are
                            playing for an hour at a time so as not to descend into stressful meltdown phase. Frank , on the
                            other hand, is not overly impressed as it is ” nowhere near enough time to play a good game of
                            pirates” but he is willing to go along with it for a while as even he becomes stressed out when
                            Bertie displays signs of being overwhelmed</p>

                        all the red bricks, Theo “, ( teddy friend from across the road, very cute and easy to get along
                        with) ” you can look out the windows and doors for us and Betty “( a pretty girl teddy from

                        <p>Frank looks around the table with an air of teddy bear authority ” We don’t have long so we’d
                            better get a move on folks…. anyone not want their Jammy Dodger? ” This last request is aimed at
                            Bertie who is still struggling to wean himself off the familiar Party Ring biscuits he so loved
                            in foster bear. We are trying to introduce a wider variety of food into his diet but his need
                            for control and security is hampering this somewhat. Frank, on the other hand, is making the
                            most of this need to stick with the familiar and is happily hoovering up any bits that Bertie
                            rejects. ( “you always told me we shouldn’t waste good food)” he splutters when I challenge him
                            on his hoovering habits.( “I am doing us all a favour!”)</p>
